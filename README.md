# My presentations

This repository contains the presentations I use for speeches, trainings and workshops. You will also find additional materials - if I mention them during the speech ðŸ˜Ž

Feel free to comment and ask questions. Requests for clarification of unclear issues are especially welcome.


Here I will post information about events where you can meet me.


Please note that sometimes during a lecture I may add additional material that is not included here, or I may not use all the slides or materials contained in this repository.
