# Good Morning, Hello and Welcome!

## RxJS to the rescue

---

# Some time ago

I was asked to make simple feature at backoffice panel.

--

Business prepared description.

--

Backenders prepared all required API.

--

Backoffice was build with components framework.

--

I needed only to use components, connect to API and do simple logic.

---

# Some time ago

I needed only to use components, connect to API and do simple logic.

--

Using ready-made components was not a problem.

--

Connecting the API was not problematic.

--

Remember? I needed only to use components, connect to API and do simple logic.

--

This simple logic was like walking through the valleys of hell

---

# Simple logic


The functionality that was to be implemented was to allow for managing the list of services offered by the entity.

--

This list was supposed to be saved along with all the other changes (UX had a fantasy).

--

Items in the list could be added, removed, turned on and off, and details edited.

It's really simple.

--

Anyone can write it.

--

And if he can't, he'll learn over the weekend and do it.

---

# Simple logic vs API

--

API designed and implemented by RED (REST Entity Developer)

--

The backoffice app had to determine the differences between the state from the database (query) and the target state.

--

Then, through api calls (post, put, delete) bring the state of the database to the target (one by one)

--

Not so easy already

---

# Simple logic not easy at all

In addition to the need to specify individual commands, it was necessary to properly define the payload with which they were to be invoked.

--

And also needed proper error handling.

--

And the correct determination of the final value.


---

# Who if not me?

--

I rolled up my sleeves and got to work on the implementation

--

After four days I couldn't find myself in the logic I had written.

--

I decided to refactor.

--

After two days of Clean Code rewriting...

--

... the code was even less readable and the algorithm was completely misunderstood.

--

A different approach was needed.

--

*Especially since my supervisor was getting impatient*

# RxJS to the rescue

---
class: center, middle 

# Sync/Async x Single/Multiple

---
class: center, middle 

# Streams

---
class: center, middle 

# Observable streams

---

# Why observable streams?

--

Because every API request in async. 

--

When dealing with multiple ongoing requests if response to one arrives it can be further processed.

--

Code is describing flow - what to do instead of how to do

---

# Declarative + Imperative 

--

RxJS allows to divide algorithms into declarative and imperative parts

--

Pipes flow is described declarative.

--

Operators can be declarative or imperative.

--

In both cases operators can be considered as close to functional programming

# Showtime ?

---

# API endpoints

--

```typescript
class ServiceProviderServicesService {
  public getServicesFor(serviceProviderId: number): Array<ServiceProviderService>;
  public addService(serviceProviderId: number; service: ServiceProviderService): void;
  public removeService(serviceProviderServideId: number): void;
  public updateService(serviceProviderServideId: number; service: ServiceProviderService): void;
  public setServiceStatus(serviceProviderServideId: number; isActive: boolean): void;  
}
```

---

# Async API endpoints

--

```typescript
class ServiceProviderServicesService {
  public getServicesFor(serviceProviderId: number): Promise<Array<ServiceProviderService>>;
  public addService(serviceProviderId: number; service: ServiceProviderService): Promise<void>;
  public removeService(serviceProviderServideId: number): Promise<void>;
  public updateService(serviceProviderServideId: number; service: ServiceProviderService): Promise<void>;
  public setServiceStatus(serviceProviderServideId: number; isActive: boolean): Promise<void>;  
}
```

---

# Observable API endpoints

--

```typescript
class ServiceProviderServicesService {
  public getServicesFor(serviceProviderId: number): Observable<Array<ServiceProviderService>>;
  public addService(serviceProviderId: number; service: ServiceProviderService): Observable<void>;
  public removeService(serviceProviderServideId: number): Observable<void>;
  public updateService(serviceProviderServideId: number; service: ServiceProviderService): Observable<void>;
  public setServiceStatus(serviceProviderServideId: number; isActive: boolean): Observable<void>;  
}
```

---
class: center, middle 
# Wait a moment

--

Why Observable if it is Single?

---
# Cancelation Token 

--

Allows you to abort the request.

--

We won't get the result anymore and we don't need to have our own skip logic

--

When properly implemented on the server side, it allows you to reduce resource consumption - or at least reduce data transfer

---

# Observable instead of Promise for single values

--

It allows for easy integration with the rest of the flow.

--

It allows you to use the cancelation token and cancel the request anywhere.

---

# Query API

--

```typescript
class ServiceProviderServicesService {
  public getServicesFor(serviceProviderId: number): Observable<Array<ServiceProviderService>> {
    return this.http
      .get<Array<ServiceProviderService>>(`${this.apiUrl}/providers/${serviceProviderId}/services`)
  }
  
  ...
}
```

---

# Sometimes backend is busy


---

# Query API

--

```typescript
class ServiceProviderServicesService {
  public getServicesFor(serviceProviderId: number): Observable<Array<ServiceProviderService>> {
    return this.http
      .get<Array<ServiceProviderService>>(`${this.apiUrl}/providers/${serviceProviderId}/services`)
      .pipe(
        retry(3) // retry a failed request up to 3 times
      );
  }
  
  ...
}
```

---

# Command API

--

```typescript
class ServiceProviderServicesService {
  public addService(serviceProviderId: number; service: ServiceProviderService): Observable<void> {
    return this.http
      .post<void>(`${this.apiUrl}/providers/${serviceProviderId}/services`, service);
  }

  public removeService(serviceProviderServideId: number): Observable<void> {
    return this.http
      .delete<void>(`${this.apiUrl}/providers/services/${serviceProviderServideId}`);
  }

  public updateService(serviceProviderServideId: number; service: ServiceProviderService): Observable<void> {
    return this.http
      .put<void>(`${this.apiUrl}/providers/services/${serviceProviderServideId}`, service);
  }

  public setServiceStatus(serviceProviderServideId: number; isActive: boolean): Observable<void> {
    return this.http
      .put<void>(`${this.apiUrl}/providers/services/${serviceProviderServideId}/status`, service);    
  }
}
```

Basically... nothing special

# Don't ask for an example without using RxJS

--

I don't know how to fit it in slides 沽ｭ

---

# What about error handling?

--

RxJs will handle error propagation.

--

Until we don't need specific error processing it should be enough.

--

# What about request cancelation?

--

Again, RxJS will handle it and propagate accordingly.

---
class: center, middle

# But still one more thing to handle

---

# What about the application state if the write process does not go well?

--

In the case of this application, if an error occurs, it will be forced to reload the entire state.

--

But in fact, the correct behavior is to ensure that we have a correct and up-to-date state after processing is complete.

--

Let's try to improve it!

class ServiceProviderServicesComponent {
  protected onProcessSave(): Observable<void> {
    const currentServices = this.currentServices;
    
    return this.serviceProviderServicesService.getServicesFor(this.serviceProviderId)
      .pipe(
        switchMap((services: Array<ServiceProviderService>) => {
          return forkJoin(
            services.map((service: ServiceProviderService): Observable<void> => {
              const currentService = this.getServiceByIdFrom(service.id, currentServices);

              return this.createUpdateOrDelete(service, currentService);            
            })
          );
